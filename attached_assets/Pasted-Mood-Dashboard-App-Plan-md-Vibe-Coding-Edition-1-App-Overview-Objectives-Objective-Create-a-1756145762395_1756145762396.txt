Mood Dashboard App – Plan.md (Vibe Coding Edition)
1. App Overview & Objectives

Objective:
Create a lightweight, user-friendly, always-accessible web app to capture participant mood feedback in real-time and display it in a visually engaging dashboard. Designed for live events (<100 participants), with playful and colorful UI while keeping a minimalist feel.

Key Goals:

Easy QR-code-based participant submissions.

Optional name/email collection for limited tracking.

Real-time dashboard updates with pie chart, mood feed, heatmap/grid, and trend visualization.

Post-event accessibility and CSV export.

2. Target Audience

Event participants (onsite or online).

Organizers seeking real-time mood insights and post-event analytics.

Small-scale events, <100 participants.

3. Core Functional Modules
Frontend (Participant Input & Dashboard Display)

Mood Submission Form:

Mood selection (emoji with tooltip: happy, super happy, neutral, anxious, sad, etc.)

Name/email optional (single submission if provided)

Privacy consent display

Confirmation animation/feedback

Dashboard Visualization:

Pie Chart: Mood distribution (%)

Live-Updating Emoji Feed: Displays submissions anonymously

Mood Grid/Heatmap: Color-coded for energy/impact

Trend Over Time: Line chart for mood changes during the event

Totals/Counts per Mood

Floating emojis for playful, dynamic effect

UI/UX Principles:

Clean, minimalist layout with playful color accents

Responsive design for mobile & desktop

Visual clarity prioritized over branding (branding can be added later)

Backend (Data Handling & Real-Time Updates)

Submission Handling:

Accept mood input + optional name/email + timestamp

Enforce single submission for named/email participants, multiple for anonymous

Database / Storage:

Lightweight, self-contained solution (e.g., Firebase/Firestore, JSON, or SQLite)

Realtime updates for dashboard display

Export Feature:

CSV export of all submissions (mood, timestamp, name/email if provided)

Security & Privacy:

Optional participant data stored securely

Live dashboard remains fully anonymous

HTTPS hosting for secure access

Real-Time Dashboard Functionality

Tracks mood trends over time

Maintains accessibility after event for review

4. Conceptual Data Model
Field	Type	Notes
id	Unique ID	Auto-generated submission ID
mood	String	Emoji/mood type (required)
name	String	Optional
email	String	Optional
timestamp	DateTime	Submission time
5. High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations

Frontend:

React, Vue, or Vanilla JS for live updates

Charting & visualization: Chart.js, ApexCharts, or D3.js

Backend / Database:

Firebase / Firestore for easy real-time updates and cloud hosting

Optional: Node.js/Express server for handling submissions if self-hosted

Real-Time Communication:

WebSocket or Firebase Realtime Database for live dashboard updates

Hosting:

Cloud-hosted web app for anytime access

HTTPS for secure connection

6. Security & Privacy Considerations

Display privacy consent before submission

Keep live dashboard fully anonymous

Optional name/email stored securely, not shown on dashboard

Minimal personal data collected; HTTPS hosting

7. Development Structure (Vibe Coding Style)

Frontend: Form, dashboard, visualizations

Backend: Submission handling, data storage, export, real-time feed

Iterative live coding—frontend and backend work together simultaneously

Continuous feedback loop: submissions immediately reflected in dashboard

8. Potential Challenges & Solutions
Challenge	Solution
Real-time updates	Use Firebase or WebSockets for push updates
Anonymous vs tracked submissions	Separate handling logic in backend
Clean yet playful UI balance	Minimalist design + selective playful elements like floating emojis
Post-event dashboard persistence	Persist data in cloud DB or server storage
9. Future Expansion Possibilities

Multi-event support with configurable dashboards

Mood trends across multiple events

Event branding and theme customization

Advanced analytics (average mood, mood peaks)

Optional email follow-ups for participants
